Holler at me if you have questions, compliments, or complaints -- `notes @ theforeverarrow.com`.   \r\n\r\n####dued, what?\r\n`dued` started as a very simple way to get tomorrows date but it quickly expanded. Visit the [dued Help page](https://github.com/unforswearing/dued/blob/master/help.md) for a bit of documentation. You can also run the script and type `help` or `dued help` in the Alfred workflow and the help page will open in your default browser. The `dued` Alfred workflow and system service are written in AppleScript.     \r\n\r\n####dued, more!!  \r\nI do not want to overload `dued` with options, but I am working on a few ideas. Check the [To Do section](https://github.com/unforswearing/dued/blob/master/help.md#to-do) of the [Help page](https://github.com/unforswearing/dued/blob/master/help.md) for info.  \r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
