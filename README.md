####dued, yeah!
To use `dued`, download whatever version will suit your needs and have fun fulfilling your hearts desires. Holler at me if you have questions, compliments, or complaints -- `notes @ theforeverarrow.com`.   

####dued, what?
`dued` started as a very simple way to get tomorrows date but it quickly expanded. Visit the [dued Help page](https://github.com/unforswearing/dued/blob/master/help.md) for a bit of documentation. You can also run the script and type `help` or `dued help` in the Alfred workflow and the help page will open in your default browser. The `dued` Alfred workflow and system service are written in AppleScript.     

####dued, more!!  
I do not want to overload `dued` with options, but I am working on a few ideas. Check the [To Do section](https://github.com/unforswearing/dued/blob/master/help.md#to-do) of the [Help page](https://github.com/unforswearing/dued/blob/master/help.md) for info.
