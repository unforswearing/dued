Formatted dates for plain text notes via applescript. 

I take a lot of notes in plain text and often want to add a due date to current tasks, but I'm usually too lazy to open up a calendar. This script allows me to quickly grab a future date or time and copy it to my clipboard without leaving my current note taking application.  

Run the script, type `d t` (days and time (hours) from now), `d` (days from now), or `h t` (hours from now), and the script will copy the formatted date to your clipboard or replace the text in your editor (text replacement occurs in the OSX Service only). 

`dued` works on 10.6 and above. 

This is what `dued` does with Alfred
