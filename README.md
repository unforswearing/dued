====
Alfred extension and system service for formatted dates via applescript. 

I take a lot of notes in plain text and often want to add a due date to current tasks, but I'm usually too lazy to open up a calendar. This script allows me to quickly grab a future date or time and copy it to my clipboard without leaving my current note taking application.  

Run the script, type 

- `0` - zero for today's date  
- `h t` - hours (`h`) from now   
- `d` - days (`d`) from now   
- `d t` - days and time (`t` represents hours) from now   
- `y d` - past date (`y`) and the number of days from today     

The script will copy the formatted date to your clipboard or replace the text in your editor (text replacement occurs in the OSX Service only).   
   
`dued` version 0.0.2  Alfred Workflow and system service work on 10.6 and above.   
The `dued` script possibly works for earlier versions (untested).   

This is what `dued` does with Alfred

####dued, yeah!
`dued` is currently available as an Alfred Workflow, Application, Applescript, and OSX System Service/Workflow. To use `dued`, clone/fork/download the zip and have fun fulfilling your hearts desires. Holler at me if you have questions, compliments, or complaints. I accept [issues](https://github.com/unforswearing/dued/issues) and email -- `notes @ theforeverarrow.com`.   

####dued, what?
Visit the [dued Help page](https://github.com/unforswearing/dued/blob/master/help.md) for a bit of documentation.        You can find details about the [pre-dued scripts here](http://scriptogr.am/unforswearing/post/future-dates).   

####dued, more!!  
I do not want to overload `dued` with options, but I am working on a few ideas. Check the [To Do section](https://github.com/unforswearing/dued/blob/master/help.md#to-do) of the [Help page](https://github.com/unforswearing/dued/blob/master/help.md) for info.
