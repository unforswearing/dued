## dued, what?

`dued` started as a very simple way to get tomorrows date but it quickly expanded. The `dued` Alfred workflow and system service are written in AppleScript.

## dued, yeah!

To use `dued`, download whatever version will suit your needs and watch your dreams come true. Visit the [dued Help page](https://github.com/unforswearing/dued/blob/master/help.md) for a bit of documentation. You can also run the script and type `help` or `dued help` in the Alfred workflow and the help page will open in your default browser.

If you have questions, compliments or complaints, get in touch!

## dued, more!!

`dued` is currently pretty stable, and I'm not planning to add any new options. Let me know if you think `dued` is missing any key features!
