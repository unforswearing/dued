dued
====
Alfred extension and system service for formatted dates via applescript. 

I take a lot of notes in plain text and often want to add a due date to current tasks, but I'm usually too lazy to open up a calendar. This script allows me to quickly grab a future date or time and copy it to my clipboard without leaving my current note taking application.  

Run the script, type 

- `d t` (days and time (hours) from now) 
- `d` (days from now)   
- `h t` (hours from now)   
- `0` (zero) for today's date  
- `y d` (yesterday and days from today)   

The script will copy the formatted date to your clipboard or replace the text in your editor (text replacement occurs in the OSX Service only).   

`dued` version 0.0.2 works on 10.6 and above.   

This is what `dued` does with Alfred

Visit the [dued Help page](https://github.com/unforswearing/dued/blob/master/help.md) for a bit of documentation.        You can find details about the [pre-dued scripts here](http://scriptogr.am/unforswearing/post/future-dates).   

####dued, more!!  
I do not want to overload `dued` with options, but I am working on a few ideas. Check the [To Do section](https://github.com/unforswearing/dued/blob/master/help.md#to-do) of the [Help page](https://github.com/unforswearing/dued/blob/master/help.md) for info.
